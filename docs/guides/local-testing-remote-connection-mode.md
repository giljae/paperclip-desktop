# Local Testing Guide: Remote Connection Mode

This guide captures the exact local test paths for the remote connection mode implementation on `feature/remote-connection-mode`.

## Quick remote-mode test

Use this when you want to verify the new launcher, chooser, remote connect flow, saved connections, and menu-based quick connect.

```bash
git checkout feature/remote-connection-mode
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Notes:

- `pnpm dev` compiles the Electron shell and launches it directly from `dist/main.js`
- this is the fastest path for testing remote mode
- use it to verify:
  - chooser flow
  - remote verification states
  - sign-in-required remotes
  - saved connections CRUD
  - Connection menu quick connect entries

## Full local package test

Use this when you want the packaged desktop app shape rather than the direct dev shell.

```bash
git checkout feature/remote-connection-mode
pnpm install
pnpm test:connections
pnpm run pack
```

Important:

- use `pnpm run pack`, not `pnpm pack`
- `pnpm pack` is pnpm's built-in tarball command and does not run the Electron Builder packaging script

What `pnpm run pack` does:

1. builds the Electron TypeScript
2. stages the bundled `@paperclipai/server`
3. stages the Paperclip UI
4. runs Electron Builder with `--dir`

## Result from the latest local run

These commands were run in this repo:

```bash
pnpm test:connections
pnpm run pack
```

Observed result:

- `pnpm test:connections` passed
- `pnpm run pack` successfully completed:
  - Electron TypeScript build
  - server bundle staging
  - UI staging from `@paperclipai/ui@2026.403.0`
- Electron Builder then stopped during macOS signing with:

```text
macOS release signing requires APPLE_CODESIGN_IDENTITY or CSC_NAME.
```

## Current artifact paths

Even though the signing hook failed, Electron Builder did create an unpacked app bundle directory before aborting:

```text
release/mac/Paperclip Desktop.app
```

This path exists from the latest local run.

## Signing requirement

The current macOS packaging flow requires one of these environment variables before a full packaged build can complete:

```bash
export APPLE_CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: ..."
```

or

```bash
export CSC_NAME="Developer ID Application: ..."
```

Without one of those values, `pnpm run pack` will stop in `scripts/after-pack.mjs`.

## Recommended local test sequence

If you want the shortest reliable path today:

1. Run `pnpm dev` to test remote mode end-to-end.
2. Run `pnpm test:connections` to verify the connection logic and security checks.
3. Only run `pnpm run pack` if you have a signing identity configured or specifically want to inspect the partially-built unpacked app bundle.

## Testing when you do not have a remote Paperclip

You can still test a large part of the feature without a real remote.

### Expected negative-path tests

These are useful and should behave as follows:

- `https://localhost:3100`
  - expected to fail
  - the embedded local Paperclip server is plain HTTP, not HTTPS
  - if nothing is listening there yet, `host unreachable` is expected
- `http://localhost:3100`
  - once the embedded local mode is already running, this should identify Paperclip but reject it for remote mode
  - expected reason: `deploymentMode=local_trusted`
  - this is correct behavior, not a bug
- `https://example.com`
  - expected result: reachable but not Paperclip
- malformed URLs
  - expected result: inline validation failure

Important:

- the desktop app intentionally blocks `local_trusted` remotes in remote mode
- the normal embedded local startup uses `local_trusted` by default
- so `localhost` is not a valid positive remote-mode target for this feature

### Positive-path remote test without owning a real remote machine

If you want to test the success path on your own machine, start a second Paperclip instance manually in upstream `authenticated` mode on a different port.

At minimum, that instance needs:

- `PAPERCLIP_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=authenticated`
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET=...`

Useful additional settings for a local authenticated test instance:

- `PORT=3200`
- `PAPERCLIP_AUTH_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3200`
- `PAPERCLIP_ALLOWED_HOSTNAMES=127.0.0.1,localhost`

That gives you a remote-mode target like:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:3200
```

This is the easiest way to test:

- verified authenticated remote
- sign-in-required state
- bootstrap/setup-required state
- saved remote profiles
- reconnect behavior
- remote window isolation

If that authenticated test instance has not been bootstrapped yet, the desktop launcher now stays open in a remote recovery loop and gives you:

- `Open Setup in Browser`
- `Retry Verification`
- `Back to Connections`
- `Switch to Local`

That is the expected behavior for `bootstrapStatus=bootstrap_pending`.

## What to verify manually

- Local vs Remote chooser behavior
- `Remember my choice and don't ask again`
- remote verification success for authenticated Paperclip remotes
- sign-in-required remote behavior
- setup-required remote behavior, including the launcher recovery loop
- blocking of:
  - non-Paperclip endpoints
  - `local_trusted` remotes
  - malformed URLs
  - embedded credential URLs
- saved connections:
  - add
  - edit
  - duplicate
  - delete
  - reconnect from the Connection menu
- local boot path still opens the embedded server flow
