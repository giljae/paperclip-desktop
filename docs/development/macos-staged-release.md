# Paperclip Desktop — Staged macOS Release Guide

## Purpose

This document explains the current macOS release architecture in this repository:

- what changed
- why it works now
- how to build local signed artifacts
- how to verify them
- how to debug failures
- what a new developer needs to know to work on the flow safely

This guide is written for developers who know nothing about the project yet.

For the CI/release workflow decision log, see `docs/development/release-automation-log.md`.
For the repeatable release operator steps, see `docs/development/release-runbook.md`.

## Short version

The macOS packaging flow no longer treats the repo root as the packaging source of truth.

Instead, the release command:

1. builds the real runtime payload
2. creates a temporary stage directory for one architecture
3. copies only the app contents we intend to ship into that stage
4. generates a minimal package manifest and Electron Builder config in the stage
5. runs Electron Builder from the stage directory
6. exports the finished artifacts into `release/local-macos/{arch}`
7. verifies signatures on the resulting app bundle and nested native binaries

That staged approach is closer to how mature desktop packaging repos such as `pingdotgg/t3code` structure their release build.

## Why the old approach was not good enough

The old macOS flow built from the repo root. That had a few problems:

- the packaging context was larger than the app we actually ship
- the packaging step depended on repo-root layout rather than a clean ship payload
- it was harder to reason about exactly what was in the final app
- staged-signing issues in nested native payloads were mixed together with unrelated repo files

For release quality, the packaged app should be derived from a narrowly scoped runtime payload, not from the full development repository.

## What changed

Two main pieces were added:

1. `scripts/release-macos-local.mjs`
2. `scripts/stage-after-pack.mjs`

The package scripts were updated so the macOS local release path now goes through the staged flow:

```bash
pnpm release:mac:local
pnpm release:mac:local:x64
pnpm release:mac:local:arm64
pnpm dist:mac
```

## What the stage contains

For each mac architecture, the stage directory contains only the runtime payload needed to build the real app:

- `dist/`
  Electron main/preload compiled output
- `app-server/server/`
  bundled server output, bundled UI output, and production server dependencies
- `app-server/node-bin/`
  bundled Node runtime for the target architecture
- `build/icon.png`
- `build/icon.icns`
- `build/entitlements.mac.plist`
- `build/entitlements.mac.inherit.plist`
- generated minimal `package.json`
- generated minimal `electron-builder.json`

That stage is intentionally not a reduced placeholder. It is the actual app payload we want to ship.

## How the staged build works

### Step 1. Build the runtime inputs

The staged release script can run the normal build steps itself:

```bash
pnpm build
pnpm prepare-server
pnpm build-ui
```

Those produce:

- `dist/`
- `build/server-bundle/mac-x64/server`
- `build/server-bundle/mac-arm64/server`
- `build/node-bin/mac-x64`
- `build/node-bin/mac-arm64`

### Step 2. Create a temporary per-arch stage

For each requested architecture, the script creates a fresh temp directory under the system temp root. Example:

```text
/var/folders/.../paperclip-macos-stage-x64-XXXXXX
/var/folders/.../paperclip-macos-stage-arm64-XXXXXX
```

Each architecture is staged independently. This prevents one architecture’s payload from contaminating the other.

### Step 3. Copy only the app payload

The script copies the runtime files into the staged app layout:

- `dist` from the repo root
- the server bundle for the requested arch
- the Node runtime for the requested arch
- mac build resources and entitlements

It also normalizes symlinks inside the copied server bundle:

- removes broken symlinks
- rewrites copied absolute symlinks to relative ones where needed
- removes `node_modules/.bin` shims that are not part of the shipped runtime

This matters because broken symlinks and non-runtime shim files are common sources of `codesign` failure.

### Step 4. Generate a minimal stage package manifest

The stage does not reuse the repo’s full `package.json`.

Instead, the script generates a small runtime-only manifest that contains:

- app name
- version
- metadata such as description/author/homepage
- `main: dist/main.js`
- only runtime dependencies

This keeps the stage small and makes it obvious what Electron Builder is packaging.

### Step 5. Generate a minimal stage Electron Builder config

The script also generates a stage-local `electron-builder.json`.

That config tells Electron Builder to package:

- `dist/**/*`
- `package.json`
- `app-server/server/**/*` as extra resources
- `app-server/node-bin/**/*` as extra resources

It also configures mac targets, hardened runtime, entitlements, and `signIgnore` for the nested `app-server` payload.

### Step 6. Install only runtime dependencies in the stage

The stage runs:

```bash
npm install --omit=dev --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
```

This keeps the packaging environment focused on runtime dependencies and avoids dragging dev-only repo context into the release app.

### Step 7. Run Electron Builder from the stage

Electron Builder runs with:

- `--projectDir <stage app dir>`
- `--config <stage>/electron-builder.json`
- `--mac`
- `--x64` or `--arm64`
- `--publish never`

That means the packaged app is built from the stage, not the repo root.

### Step 8. Export artifacts into the repo

After packaging, the script copies the stage output into:

```text
release/local-macos/x64
release/local-macos/arm64
```

Those output folders are the artifacts developers should test locally before any notarization decision.

## Why signing works now

### Stock Electron Builder is still used where it should be used

We kept stock Electron Builder signing for:

- the main `.app`
- the Electron frameworks
- the helper apps

That is the part Electron Builder handles well.

### Why the staged flow still needs a small custom sign step

The nested `Contents/Resources/app-server` payload includes:

- bundled `node`
- embedded Postgres binaries
- `.node` native modules
- `.dylib` files
- non-binary data files and symlinks

In staged packaging, letting Electron Builder treat that tree as a generic recursive sign target was not reliable enough, because it attempted to walk into content that should not be signed as code:

- broken symlinks
- copied packaging detritus
- non-Mach-O files in native package trees
- `.bin` shims

So the current design is:

- Electron Builder signs the app bundle normally
- `signIgnore` excludes `Contents/Resources/app-server/**` from Electron Builder’s recursive sign pass
- `scripts/stage-after-pack.mjs` signs only real Mach-O files under `app-server`

That hook:

- cleans bundle metadata
- removes broken symlinks
- clears `._*`, `.DS_Store`, and xattrs
- detects actual Mach-O binaries by header, not filename alone
- signs only:
  - executable Mach-O files
  - `.node` files
  - `.dylib` files

This is why the current flow is stable: it narrows the custom signing logic to the one subtree that Electron Builder could not safely recurse through in staged packaging.

### Ad hoc signing is gone

Ad hoc signing is fully removed from the current path.

The staged flow now requires a real `Developer ID Application` identity. If no valid identity is available, the build fails.

`scripts/release-macos-local.mjs` resolves the identity from the active keychain using:

```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

The current build expects a `Developer ID Application: ...` identity and passes that into:

- the staged custom nested signer
- the post-build verification step

## Prerequisites for a new developer

To work on this flow locally, a developer needs:

### Required tooling

- macOS
- Xcode Command Line Tools
- Node.js compatible with the repo
- `pnpm`
- access to the repo

Install Xcode CLT:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

### Required signing identity

For signed local macOS builds, the developer must have a valid `Developer ID Application` certificate installed in their login keychain.

Check it with:

```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

Expected output includes something like:

```text
Developer ID Application: Your Name Or Team (TEAMID)
```

If there are multiple Developer ID Application identities installed, set one explicitly:

```bash
export APPLE_CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name Or Team (TEAMID)"
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="TEAMID"
```

## Local build commands

### Build both architectures

```bash
pnpm release:mac:local
```

### Build x64 only

```bash
pnpm release:mac:local:x64
```

### Build arm64 only

```bash
pnpm release:mac:local:arm64
```

### Reuse already-built runtime artifacts

If `dist/`, `build/server-bundle/...`, and `build/node-bin/...` are already present, you can skip rebuilding those inputs:

```bash
node scripts/release-macos-local.mjs --arch x64 --skip-build --skip-install
node scripts/release-macos-local.mjs --arch arm64 --skip-build --skip-install
```

Useful flags:

- `--arch x64`
- `--arch arm64`
- `--skip-build`
- `--skip-install`
- `--keep-stage`
- `--output-root <dir>`

## Relationship to CI

The staged local flow is the basis for the macOS CI build flow as well.

The intended CI pattern is:

1. build signed staged artifacts with no notarization
2. test and approve those artifacts
3. notarize the approved prebuilt `.app` later
4. repackage ZIP/DMG from that approved notarized app

That split exists to keep macOS build verification fast enough and to avoid burning runner minutes on Apple notarization before the artifacts are approved.

The detailed CI decision log and instructions live in `docs/development/release-automation-log.md`.

## What files to test

After a successful build:

### x64

- `release/local-macos/x64/mac/Paperclip Desktop.app`
- `release/local-macos/x64/Paperclip Desktop-1.0.0.dmg`
- `release/local-macos/x64/Paperclip Desktop-1.0.0-mac.zip`
- `release/local-macos/x64/verification-summary.json`

### arm64

- `release/local-macos/arm64/mac-arm64/Paperclip Desktop.app`
- `release/local-macos/arm64/Paperclip Desktop-1.0.0-arm64.dmg`
- `release/local-macos/arm64/Paperclip Desktop-1.0.0-arm64-mac.zip`
- `release/local-macos/arm64/verification-summary.json`

For first-pass local QA, launch the `.app` bundles directly.

## What to verify manually

Before approving notarization, test:

- the app launches
- the splash flow completes
- the bundled server starts
- the UI loads correctly
- the app can reach the bundled Node runtime
- embedded Postgres starts and basic product flows work
- the app launched from the ZIP artifact behaves the same way

## How verification works

After each staged build, the script runs:

```bash
node scripts/verify-macos-release.mjs release/local-macos/<arch>
```

That verifier checks:

- app bundle signature
- main app executable signature
- helper app executable signatures
- bundled `node`
- embedded Postgres binaries
- `.node` native modules
- `.dylib` files

It writes a machine-readable summary to:

```text
release/local-macos/<arch>/verification-summary.json
```

The verifier does not require stapling by default. That is intentional because local testing happens before notarization.

## Example verification commands

### Check the app bundle

```bash
codesign --verify --deep --strict --verbose=2 release/local-macos/x64/mac/Paperclip\ Desktop.app
codesign -dvv release/local-macos/x64/mac/Paperclip\ Desktop.app
```

### Check bundled Node

```bash
codesign --verify --strict --verbose=2 \
  release/local-macos/x64/mac/Paperclip\ Desktop.app/Contents/Resources/app-server/node-bin/node

codesign -dvv \
  release/local-macos/x64/mac/Paperclip\ Desktop.app/Contents/Resources/app-server/node-bin/node
```

### Check embedded Postgres

```bash
codesign --verify --strict --verbose=2 \
  release/local-macos/x64/mac/Paperclip\ Desktop.app/Contents/Resources/app-server/server/node_modules/@embedded-postgres/darwin-x64/native/bin/initdb
```

### Check a native module

```bash
codesign --verify --strict --verbose=2 \
  release/local-macos/x64/mac/Paperclip\ Desktop.app/Contents/Resources/app-server/server/node_modules/@img/sharp-darwin-x64/lib/sharp-darwin-x64.node
```

## Typical developer workflow

For a new developer working on mac packaging:

1. Install dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Confirm signing identity

```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

3. Build one architecture first

```bash
pnpm release:mac:local:arm64
```

4. Launch the built `.app`

5. Inspect `verification-summary.json`

6. If the packaging change is correct, build the second architecture

```bash
pnpm release:mac:local:x64
```

7. Test both artifacts

8. Only after approval, move on to any notarization work

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: no signing identity found

Symptom:

- the staged build fails before packaging or during the nested sign step

Check:

```bash
security find-identity -v -p codesigning
```

Fix:

- install the correct `Developer ID Application` certificate
- or set `APPLE_CODESIGN_IDENTITY` explicitly

### Problem: multiple Developer ID Application identities are installed

Symptom:

- the staged script refuses to choose one automatically

Fix:

```bash
export APPLE_CODESIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Exact Team Name (TEAMID)"
export APPLE_TEAM_ID="TEAMID"
```

### Problem: `codesign` fails inside `app-server`

Common causes:

- broken symlinks
- copied `.bin` shims
- non-Mach-O files being treated as code

Why it is usually fixed now:

- the stage cleanup removes broken symlinks
- `.bin` shims are pruned before packaging
- the custom sign hook signs only actual Mach-O files

If this regresses, inspect:

- `scripts/release-macos-local.mjs`
- `scripts/stage-after-pack.mjs`
- `release/local-macos/<arch>/verification-summary.json`

### Problem: Electron Builder signs the app, but nested binaries are wrong

Symptom:

- the top-level `.app` is signed
- bundled `node`, Postgres, or `.node` files are missing the expected identity

Check:

```bash
codesign -dvv release/local-macos/arm64/mac-arm64/Paperclip\ Desktop.app/Contents/Resources/app-server/node-bin/node
```

Expected:

- `Authority=Developer ID Application: ...`
- `TeamIdentifier=<your team>`

If not, the likely breakage is in the staged nested sign step, not the top-level Electron Builder sign step.

### Problem: DMG shows unsigned

Current behavior:

- the verifier records DMG signature state
- the local process does not fail if the DMG itself is unsigned
- the important thing for pre-notarization local testing is that the contained app bundle is correctly signed

That is expected in the current local testing flow.

## What not to do

- Do not package mac releases for local review directly from arbitrary repo-root state
- Do not reintroduce ad hoc signing
- Do not notarize automatically as part of local build-and-test
- Do not broaden the custom signer to recurse blindly over `app-server`
- Do not treat non-binary resource files as sign targets

## Files that matter most

- `package.json`
- `electron-builder.yml`
- `scripts/release-macos-local.mjs`
- `scripts/stage-after-pack.mjs`
- `scripts/after-pack.mjs`
- `scripts/verify-macos-release.mjs`
- `build/entitlements.mac.plist`
- `build/entitlements.mac.inherit.plist`

## Current status

At the time this guide was written, the staged flow:

- builds per-arch temporary staging directories
- produces local signed app bundles for `x64` and `arm64`
- verifies the main app bundle and nested runtime binaries with `codesign`
- does not notarize
- does not staple
- is intended for local review before any Apple submission step
